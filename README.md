# My open-source game assets

A collection of bitmap graphics that I made for my game projects.

All the assets are saved using the [XPM3 file format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_PixMap#XPM3). Because the format wraps data in C code, effectively resulting in **Assets as Code** (_AaC_).

All the assets are published under the GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE, v3 or later.
