# Sporniket's Wrecking Ball

## About the game

A brick breaker game. It evolved from a drill of writing a game for Atari ST fully in assembly language, see [sporny-wrecking-ball](https://github.com/sporniket/sporny-wrecking-ball).

To date, the initial choices created limitations requiring a substantial rewrite, and I left it in an unfinished state. I may finish it some day.

## Features of the assets

The assets are 16 colors, using the [dawnbringer 16 palette](https://lospec.com/palette-list/dawnbringer-16) :
